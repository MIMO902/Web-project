            <h5><span>About The Company</span></h5>
            <p>Real estate companies help people find new homes and lands, but doing so requires dealing with a vast amount of data.
                Processing and analyzing data from paper sources are proven complex and error-prone.
                The most significant risk of paper-based operations is fraught with risk if that paper trail is lost or misplaced.
                In addition, generating valuable reports can be extremely difficult. For real estate companies, the main challenges are collecting data and then storing the data in digital format to facilitate further analysis and operations.
                Another problem is that communication is mainly possible over the phone. Therefore, developing a web application that facilitates and organizes property information and descriptions can facilitate communication, data storage, and analysis.
